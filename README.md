# CMPG-323-Overview---24361879
I created a repository called CMPG 323 - "student number".
Inside that respository I created milestones and labels which I will use in my various projects.
I will update the readme file with projects 2 through 5 as I complete them.

Below is a flow chart demonstrating the structure of my profile and this specific repository.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    MyProfile-->Overview;
    Overview-->Project1;
    Overview-->Project2;
    Overview-->Project3;
    Overview-->Project4;
    Overview-->Project5;
    Overview-->ExamPOE;
```

Below is a graph representing my branching strategy for the repository branches, main and master (which i'll use to feed 'ready to deploy code' into main)

```mermaid
  gitGraph
       commit
       commit
       branch master
       commit
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
       commit
       commit
```

The purpose of the .gitignore file is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git, remain untracked.
If I was allowed to keep this repository private and give admin rights to trusted individuals, it would've ensured a greater level of protection of confidential information.

Have a look at the "insights" form which contains two charts. I am only able to produc 2 charts even though 4 was requested. Take note, Burndown charts were not an option and that's why they're not in the overview repo.
